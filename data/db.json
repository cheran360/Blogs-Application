No matter what time it is whether its breakfast, lunch, or dinner we grab a hamburger and might throw in some fries and a soda to go with it. Many restaurants are known to make their hamburgers in a specific way. Preparation differs from restaurant to restaurant. But what really makes a hamburger taste so delicious? Depending where you go they will taste different but they are all structured the same. It consists of a bun, a ground meat patty and often ingredients such as cheese, onion slices, lettuce and other condiments. I occasionally like to buy juicy burgers that look and taste great. When your food is served it does not only have to taste good, but also has to look good in order for it to be appetizing. Hamburgers, no doubt, look very pleasing to the eyes and are round in shape with many layers of nutrients.\n\nI rememeber this day when I was gonna go to burger with my family and I will never forget how good I felt that day since I love eating hamburgers and I love the feeling in my throat when I eat and swallow the hamburger.This wonderful day that I wanted to go with my friedns and family to burger king I did not have money.I had to ask my parents for money and had no luck.And guess what ? They did not have any money either so I was crying because I wamted that hamburger badley but I did not have any money left in the bank or anywhere. ",
